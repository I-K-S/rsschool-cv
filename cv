my goal is to learn JS and be a great developer, my strength is diligence and attention to detail. For a long time I worked as an accountant in a construction company, at the moment I work as an engineer, I want to completely change the field of activity.
unfortunately at the moment I don't have the necessary skills in programming
my level of English is not very high. I can understand but I can't answer.
